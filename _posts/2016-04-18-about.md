Catalysee is an umbrella that holds watery desig, courses about it & transparent creative mindset that connects it all together. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6ce20e9c-0357-4808-836f-09d591c6eed1.jpg)

Watery Design courses, store & Divinely Creative podcast

Watery design is design made from 3D fluid simulations, real life fluids or both of them combined. I created this concept in order to define the narrow field, where 3D simulation, look development and animation skills merge into the design solution itself. Technical tasks only is no longer of service here. One thing is to follow the dim idea and try to make best technical decision, both in time and quality. The other is to actually solve the deeper problem and evolve from the idea into the best possible design solution that serves project goal itself. 

How does it look like? 

We find out what the project goal is and find the best way to ewoke it's meaning through the motion of the fluids. We find the best way to use it and express it through right camera angles, shapes and colors. Considering the costs, and timing, we find the best way to do it also. Always looking for the perfection of unusual looks. Who else could create the best design solution like this, than a master of watery design itself?

This is where the LearnWateryDesign course steps in. We need more of those mindflul professionals in our creative field. People, who would find the process smooth because of their problem-solving mindset, 3D motion design skills and daily habits that helps to sustain it. 

It's extremely important to have strong mindset and habits to have limitless creative energy daily. Especially for us working in vfx industry, since we see so many people burnout and have lack of joy in life. I was in those shoes few years ago, burned out deeply and it was the point where I realised I have much bigger work to do here, than just serve technical solutions. It took me 3 years to fully re-built mindset and find all the best ways to charge up and have productivity at the highest. Improving never ends, we all grow stronger and stronger every day. But nobody has to go through burnout to figure out that. 

This is where [Divinely Creative][0] podcast comes in. I share all the best practices I know to help you be in emotional, physical balance and embrace infinitely creative you. 
> 
> You need to search scattered ideas, mindset tools for great charge, balance, tutorials for fluid simulations and watery design no more.
